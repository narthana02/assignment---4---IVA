Task Description:
Load Video:

Load the provided video file.
Frame Extraction:

Extract individual frames from the video.
Spatio-Temporal Segmentation:

Perform segmentation on each frame using a technique like color thresholding or edge detection.
Track the segmented objects across frames to observe changes in motion and shape.
Identify the regions that remain consistent over time (foreground vs. background segmentation).
Scene Cut Detection:

Use pixel-based comparison or histogram differences between consecutive frames to detect abrupt changes (hard cuts).
Detect gradual scene transitions (Soft cuts) by analyzing frame-to-frame intensity changes over time.
Mark Scene Cuts:

Highlight the frames where scene cuts are detected.
Create a summary displaying the detected scene boundaries.
Result Visualization:

Display frames where scene cuts are identified and show segmentation results for selected frames.
